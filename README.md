# Bithkuil

Bithkuil is an experimental semantic-representation and developmental-learning research program from Entif AI. The project tests whether an explicit, Ithkuil-derived semantic substrate can reduce the data, parameter, compute, or developmental cost required for a bounded learner to acquire reusable relational and compositional competence.

This repository currently contains the **initial finite-world reference implementation** extracted from the ETR-2026-05 Stage 2 research package (`CP0008-20260912T115723Z-FULL.zip`, report package v0.4.7). It is an engineering reference, not a completed efficacy trial, a trained Bithkuil language model, or a full implementation of New Ithkuil.

## What is here

- `bithkuil_ref/` — finite-world semantics, independent oracle pair, codecs, small transformer student, teacher policy, checkpoint/recovery, sealing, evaluation, and constrained pedagogue adapter.
- `abi/` — token ABI and grammar-prerequisite graph used by the reference package.
- `configs/` — smoke, reference-scale, and system-design configurations.
- `schemas/` — JSON Schemas for semantic objects, run configs, and results.
- `tests/` — 29 engineering tests covering formal semantics, codecs, token symmetry, restart identity, teacher boundaries, sealing, and related invariants.
- `docs/reference/` — architecture, semantic/token contracts, Ithkuil primitive map, split/sealing rules, teacher boundaries, checkpoint lineage, and reproducibility gaps.
- `docs/research/` — the current SYS-01 preregistration and attribution/control plans from the Stage 2 package.
- `references/` — the source-grounded New Ithkuil grammar map used during the Stage 2 research pass.

The research roadmap lives in [issue #5](https://github.com/entif-ai/bithkuil/issues/5). The repository bootstrap and reproducibility work is tracked in [issue #6](https://github.com/entif-ai/bithkuil/issues/6).

## Scientific status

The reference implementation has passed its delivered engineering suite and tiny smoke runs. The larger integrated SYS-01 scientific trial has **not** been run. In particular, this repository does not yet establish that Bithkuil improves sample efficiency, compute efficiency, transfer, natural-language learning, or low-precision training.

The first scientific program deliberately separates:

1. the integrated systems effect;
2. representation-specific effects;
3. adaptive curriculum effects;
4. generic factorization effects;
5. tokenizer and sequence-length economics;
6. precision/ternary interactions; and
7. later natural-language transfer.

A generic typed representation is allowed to match or beat Bithkuil. A null result is a valid result.

## Quick start

The observed Stage 2 environment was Python 3.13.5 with CPU PyTorch 2.10.0, NumPy 2.3.5, SciPy 1.17.0, and jsonschema 4.26.0.

```sh
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
python -m pip install --extra-index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cpu -r requirements.txt
python -m unittest discover -s tests -v
```

The delivered suite should report 29 passing tests.

Run a tiny engineering lineage:

```sh
python -m bithkuil_ref.run \
  --config configs/smoke-bithkuil-ternary.json \
  --out runs/bithkuil-ternary-smoke
```

Run the corresponding controlled-language arm:

```sh
python -m bithkuil_ref.run \
  --config configs/smoke-cnl-ternary.json \
  --out runs/cnl-ternary-smoke
```

These are execution checks, not scientific confirmation.

## Reference model boundary

The implemented student is a small causal decoder-only transformer with a four-answer supervised readout: `TRUE`, `FALSE`, `UNKNOWN`, and `CONFLICT`. The reference-scale configuration contains 2,828,736 trainable parameters. The ternary branch is W1.58A8-style forward emulation over FP32 master weights, not a packed low-bit kernel.

The current Bithkuil codec is a machine-oriented, lossless finite-world representation informed by selected New Ithkuil distinctions. It is **not** valid surface New Ithkuil and does not claim to implement the language's complete morphology, phonology, lexicon, or writing system.

## Truth boundary

The developmental pedagogue is deliberately non-authoritative. It may propose curriculum choices within a bounded schema, but it does not define gold answers or certify mastery. Formal world generation and the independent oracle pair determine truth for the current synthetic domain.

The guiding rule is:

> LLM proposes; formal machinery disposes.

## Source provenance

The initial import is a public projection of the reference implementation from the ETR-2026-05 Stage 2 CP0008 package. Generated smoke results, binary checkpoints, local custodian material, private production ledgers, and unrelated publication-production artifacts are intentionally not imported into this repository.

See [`docs/PROVENANCE.md`](docs/PROVENANCE.md) for the extraction boundary and [`docs/reference/REPLICATION_GAP_MATRIX.md`](docs/reference/REPLICATION_GAP_MATRIX.md) for what remains unvalidated.
